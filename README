Description: Recursive decent parser for cs4280.  Builds a tree and prints in preorder, each level of the tree gets a double space before it prints.  For each node, it will print the label and whatever
tokens are being stored.


To run

1. Type "make" and hit enter
2. Type "./main inputfile" and hit enter
3. Type "make clean" to clean


Comments must not have spaces.  Everything else must be separated by spaces, even "end" needs a space after it.  Numbers must be non-zero but can be
positive or negative and have decimal.  

I also went back and fixed a couple issues with my scanner.  One issue caused a seg fault.  The other issue was with relational operators
not being recognized.  Added comments with name and date in main.  I've added test programs which are nearly identical to the test programs posted in canvas, only difference is that I removed spaces from the comments and added a space at the end of "end" keyword.  

Other issues: I wanted to make a productions.c and production.h file, but due to the architechture and the way I wrote scanner and testScanner I struggled to get it to work.  I wrote production functions in testScanner.c.  If I had more time I would restructure it with a productions.c/h.
